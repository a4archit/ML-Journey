# Weight Prediction
<small>`Human weight Predictor Model`</small>

A Machine Learning model that taking two variables
- **Height**: Taking person height only in *Centimetres*.
- **Person in normal see**: It is an classification input that accepts only these fields:
    - Underweight
    - Normal
    - Overweight
    - Obesity

Finally, model predicts the output using **Linear Regression** `Algorithm`.
